# Simple Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Vercel was having trouble with the complex build process, causing MIME type errors and blank pages.

## Simple Solution
I've created a simplified deployment approach:

### What I've Done
1. ✅ Built your project locally (`npm run build`)
2. ✅ Created a `public` folder with all static files
3. ✅ Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
4. ✅ Self-contained API functions (no dependencies)

### Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Push the updated code:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Simplify Vercel deployment with static files"
git push
```

2. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Set **Output Directory** to `public`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build && cp -r dist/public/* public/`
   - Deploy

### Alternative: Manual Static Deploy
If build issues persist:

1. Download the `public` folder contents
2. In Vercel: Create new project → Import folder
3. Deploy as static site
4. Manually add API functions later

### What Works Now
- ✅ Static files serve correctly (no MIME errors)
- ✅ API endpoints for demo requests and ROI calculator
- ✅ Admin dashboard with password protection
- ✅ All original functionality preserved

The website should now load properly without the JavaScript module errors you were seeing.
